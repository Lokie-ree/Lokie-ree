# Virtual Teacher Assistant

A focused web application designed to help teachers organize and manage their digital resources in virtual teaching environments. This tool addresses the specific pain point of digital resource fragmentation that teachers face when teaching online.

## Project Overview

Virtual Teacher Assistant provides a centralized repository for teaching materials, simple classroom management, and basic assignment tracking. It specifically targets the organizational challenges of virtual teaching while maintaining a streamlined, easy-to-learn interface.

### Key Features

- **Resource Organization**: Upload, categorize, and manage digital teaching materials in one place
- **Basic Class Management**: Create virtual classrooms and manage student rosters
- **Simple Assignment Tracking**: Create and track basic assignments linked to your resources
- **Resource Sharing**: Share resources with colleagues to collaborate on teaching materials

## Technical Stack

This project is built using:

- [Convex](https://convex.dev/) as the backend (database, server logic)
- [React](https://react.dev/) as the frontend (web page interactivity)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for optimized web hosting and page routing
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for building great looking accessible UI
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) for authentication

## Current Status

**Phase 1: Core Resource Management is complete.** The application currently allows users to:

- Authenticate (sign up / log in)
- Upload, view, categorize (tag), search, filter, preview, download, and delete digital teaching resources.

Phase 2 (Classroom & Assignment Features) and Phase 3 (Sharing & Refinement) are planned next.

## Development Setup

If you just cloned this codebase, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then:

1. Open the app in your browser
2. Follow the steps to authenticate with Clerk
3. Start organizing your teaching resources!
